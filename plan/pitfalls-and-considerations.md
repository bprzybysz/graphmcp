# Potential Pitfalls & Important Considerations

## Critical Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Import Cycle Issues
**Problem**: Separating UI and workflow logic can create circular imports.
**Solution**: 
- UI imports workflow, never the reverse
- Use dependency injection for shared components
- Create interfaces/protocols for loose coupling

### 2. Session State Race Conditions
**Problem**: Async workflow updates + UI refresh can cause state inconsistencies.
**Solution**:
- Lock critical sections during updates
- Use immutable state updates
- Implement state versioning for conflict detection

### 3. Memory Leaks with Large Files
**Problem**: Loading 20MB XML files into session state.
**Solution**:
- Stream large files instead of loading entirely
- Implement pagination for file lists
- Clear old data from session state regularly

### 4. Mock/Real Mode Confusion
**Problem**: Forgetting which mode is active during development.
**Solution**:
- Clear visual indicators in UI
- Log mode at startup
- Separate config files for each mode

### 5. Blocking UI During Long Operations
**Problem**: Workflow steps blocking Streamlit's event loop.
**Solution**:
- Use background tasks for long operations
- Implement proper async/await patterns
- Show progress indicators immediately

## Important Considerations

### Performance
- **Initial Load**: Lazy load components not immediately visible
- **State Size**: Limit log entries to last 1000 items
- **Refresh Rate**: Throttle updates to prevent UI flicker
- **Caching**: Use st.cache_data for expensive computations

### Testing
- **Mock Data Realism**: Ensure mocks match real data structure
- **Edge Cases**: Test with empty files, large files, errors
- **Concurrency**: Test multiple workflows running
- **State Persistence**: Test session timeout scenarios

### User Experience
- **Error Messages**: User-friendly, actionable error messages
- **Progress Feedback**: Always show what's happening
- **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, screen readers

### Code Organization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component does one thing
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined component boundaries
- **Documentation**: Docstrings for all public methods
- **Type Hints**: Use throughout for better IDE support

### Migration Strategy
- **Gradual Rollout**: Feature flags for new components
- **Rollback Plan**: Keep legacy code until stable
- **Data Migration**: Handle old session state formats
- **User Communication**: Clear changelog and migration guide

## Specific GraphMCP Considerations

### Workflow State Machine
- Must handle interrupted workflows gracefully
- State transitions must be atomic
- Recovery from partial completion

### File Processing
- Handle various file encodings
- Respect memory limits
- Progress tracking per file and batch

### Rule Application
- Rules must be versioned
- Dry-run mode for testing
- Rollback capability for applied rules

### Integration Points
- MCP client connections must be pooled
- Handle MCP server disconnections
- Timeout handling for remote operations

## Security Considerations
- Validate all file paths
- Sanitize user inputs
- Limit file sizes for uploads
- Secure storage of credentials

## Monitoring & Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Performance metrics collection
- Error rate tracking
- User action analytics

## Deployment Considerations
- Environment-specific configurations
- Health check endpoints
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Resource limits and scaling

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Over-engineering**: Start simple, iterate
2. **Premature optimization**: Profile first
3. **Ignoring edge cases**: Test thoroughly
4. **Poor error handling**: Always have fallbacks
5. **Tight coupling**: Keep components independent
6. **Missing documentation**: Document as you go
7. **Skipping tests**: Test-driven development
8. **Ignoring UX**: User feedback is crucial

## Success Indicators
- All tests passing
- Performance benchmarks met
- No memory leaks
- Clean error logs
- Positive user feedback
- Easy to add new features
- Clear documentation
- Active monitoring
