# General Rules for Database Decommissioning

## Universal Principles

### Planning and Assessment
- **Impact Analysis**: Conduct thorough impact analysis across all systems and teams
- **Dependency Mapping**: Create comprehensive dependency maps showing all database consumers
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate risks and create mitigation strategies for each identified risk
- **Timeline Planning**: Develop realistic timelines with buffer time for unexpected issues

### Communication and Stakeholder Management
- **Stakeholder Identification**: Identify all stakeholders including technical and business teams
- **Communication Plan**: Establish clear communication channels and regular update schedules
- **Change Notifications**: Provide advance notice of all changes with sufficient lead time
- **Documentation Requirements**: Maintain comprehensive documentation throughout the process

### Quality and Testing
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all affected systems
- **Integration Testing**: Perform end-to-end testing across all dependent systems
- **Performance Testing**: Validate that performance requirements are met after changes
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Conduct UAT with relevant business stakeholders

### Security and Compliance
- **Data Protection**: Ensure data protection regulations are followed during decommissioning
- **Access Control**: Review and update access controls as systems are decommissioned
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete audit trails of all decommissioning activities
- **Compliance Verification**: Verify continued compliance with relevant standards

### Monitoring and Observability
- **Monitoring Setup**: Establish monitoring for all systems during transition period
- **Alerting Configuration**: Configure alerts for critical metrics and error conditions
- **Log Aggregation**: Ensure proper log collection and analysis capabilities
- **Dashboard Creation**: Create dashboards to track decommissioning progress

### Backup and Recovery
- **Data Backup**: Create comprehensive backups before making any changes
- **Recovery Testing**: Test backup and recovery procedures before decommissioning
- **Rollback Planning**: Develop detailed rollback procedures for each phase
- **Business Continuity**: Ensure business continuity throughout the process

## Cross-Source-Type Considerations

### Multi-Source Dependencies
- **Cross-Platform References**: Identify references that span multiple source types
- **Shared Configuration**: Handle configuration shared across different system types
- **Common Libraries**: Manage shared libraries and utilities that reference the database
- **Integration Points**: Map all integration points between different source types

### Version Control and Release Management
- **Branching Strategy**: Use appropriate branching strategies for coordinated changes
- **Release Coordination**: Coordinate releases across multiple repositories and teams
- **Version Tagging**: Tag versions appropriately for rollback purposes
- **Change Tracking**: Track all changes across different source types and repositories

### Environment Management
- **Environment Parity**: Ensure consistency across development, staging, and production
- **Configuration Management**: Manage environment-specific configurations centrally
- **Secret Management**: Handle database credentials and secrets securely
- **Environment Validation**: Validate each environment after changes

### Tool and Technology Agnostic Rules
- **Language Neutrality**: Apply decommissioning principles regardless of programming language
- **Framework Independence**: Ensure rules work across different frameworks and tools
- **Platform Agnostic**: Consider rules that work across different deployment platforms
- **Tool Flexibility**: Design processes that can adapt to different toolchains

## Workflow Management

### Phase Management
- **Phase Definition**: Define clear phases with specific goals and success criteria
- **Gate Reviews**: Implement go/no-go decision points between phases
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress against defined milestones and timelines
- **Issue Management**: Manage and resolve issues systematically

### Resource Management
- **Team Coordination**: Coordinate efforts across multiple teams and skill sets
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensure adequate resource allocation for each phase
- **Skill Requirements**: Identify and ensure availability of required technical skills
- **Time Management**: Manage time effectively across parallel workstreams

### Risk Management
- **Risk Identification**: Continuously identify new risks throughout the process
- **Risk Mitigation**: Implement appropriate mitigation strategies for identified risks
- **Contingency Planning**: Develop contingency plans for high-probability risks
- **Risk Communication**: Communicate risks clearly to all stakeholders

## Documentation and Knowledge Management

### Documentation Standards
- **Documentation Quality**: Maintain high-quality, accurate, and up-to-date documentation
- **Documentation Accessibility**: Ensure documentation is accessible to all relevant teams
- **Documentation Reviews**: Implement review processes for critical documentation
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Facilitate knowledge transfer between team members

### Change Documentation
- **Change Records**: Maintain detailed records of all changes made
- **Decision Documentation**: Document key decisions and their rationale
- **Lesson Learned**: Capture lessons learned for future decommissioning efforts
- **Process Improvement**: Identify and implement process improvements

## Post-Decommissioning

### Cleanup and Finalization
- **Resource Cleanup**: Clean up all temporary resources and intermediate artifacts
- **Access Removal**: Remove unnecessary access and permissions
- **Documentation Archival**: Archive relevant documentation for future reference
- **Tool Decommissioning**: Decommission tools and systems no longer needed

### Validation and Verification
- **Success Validation**: Validate that all decommissioning objectives have been met
- **System Verification**: Verify that all systems are functioning as expected
- **Performance Validation**: Confirm that performance requirements are still met
- **Business Validation**: Validate with business stakeholders that requirements are met

### Knowledge Retention
- **Process Documentation**: Document the complete decommissioning process for future use
- **Best Practices**: Capture best practices and lessons learned
- **Tool Documentation**: Document tools and techniques that worked well
- **Team Knowledge**: Ensure knowledge is retained despite team changes

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Response
- **Escalation Procedures**: Define clear escalation paths for critical issues
- **Emergency Contacts**: Maintain up-to-date emergency contact information
- **Emergency Rollback**: Have rapid rollback procedures for critical failures
- **Crisis Communication**: Establish crisis communication protocols

### Business Continuity
- **Service Continuity**: Ensure critical business services remain available
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain data integrity throughout emergency procedures
- **Recovery Time Objectives**: Meet defined recovery time and point objectives
- **Customer Impact**: Minimize customer impact during emergency situations
